# Tenzies game 
This is simple game created in React [from this course]( https://scrimba.com/playlist/pYkgpAP). 

I use eslint (Airbnb) and vite to create this app.

After building the base version from this course I expand the application about:

- real dice faces (instead number) creating via flexbox 

- measuring game time and number of throws 

- displaying the best result 

- audio effects while you clicking the dice, buttons and winnig the game

- responsiveness (mobile friendly) 

- shaking animation

-	start screen

-  polish language

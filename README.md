# Tenzies game 
This is a simple game created in React [from this course]( https://scrimba.com/playlist/pYkgpAP). 

I used Eslint (Airbnb) and Vite to create this app.

After building the base version from this course I expanded the application to:

- real dice faces (instead of numbers) created via Flexbox 

- measuring game time and number of throws 

- displaying the best result 

- audio effects while you click the dice, and buttons and win the game

- responsiveness (mobile friendly) 

- shaking animation

- start screen

-  Polish language
